## Contributing via Pull Requests

We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests. To make the review process smoother, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the repository**: Fork the Ultralytics YOLO repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a branch**: Create a new branch in your forked repository with a descriptive name for your changes.

3. **Make your changes**: Make the changes you want to contribute. Ensure that your changes follow the coding style of the project and do not introduce new errors or warnings.

4. **Test your changes**: Test your changes locally to ensure that they work as expected and do not introduce new issues.

5. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message. Make sure to include any relevant issue numbers in your commit message.

6. **Create a pull request**: Create a pull request from your forked repository to the main Ultralytics YOLO repository. In the pull request description, provide a clear explanation of your changes and how they improve the project.

### CLA Signing

Before we can accept your pull request, you need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md). This is a legal document stating that you agree to the terms of contributing to the Ultralytics YOLO repositories. The CLA ensures that your contributions are properly licensed and that the project can continue to be distributed under the AGPL-3.0 license.

To sign the CLA, follow the instructions provided by the CLA bot after you submit your PR and add a comment in your PR saying:

```
I have read the CLA Document and I sign the CLA
```

### Google-Style Docstrings

When adding new functions or classes, please include a [Google-style docstring](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) to provide clear and concise documentation for other developers. This will help ensure that your contributions are easy to understand and maintain.

Example Google-style docstring:

```python
def example_function(arg1: int, arg2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Example function that demonstrates Google-style docstrings.

    Args:
        arg1 (int): The first argument.
        arg2 (int): The second argument.

    Returns:
        (bool): True if successful, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> result = example_function(1, 2)  # returns False
    """
    if arg1 == arg2:
        return True
    return False
```

### GitHub Actions CI Tests

Before your pull request can be merged, all GitHub Actions [Continuous Integration](CI.md) (CI) tests must pass. These tests include linting, unit tests, and other checks to ensure that your changes meet the quality standards of the project. Make sure to review the output of the GitHub Actions and fix any issues

## Reporting Bugs

We appreciate bug reports as they play a crucial role in maintaining the project's quality. When reporting bugs it is important to provide a [Minimum Reproducible Example](minimum_reproducible_example.md): a clear, concise code example that replicates the issue. This helps in quick identification and resolution of the bug.

## License

Ultralytics embraces the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) for its repositories, promoting openness, transparency, and collaborative enhancement in software development. This strong copyleft license ensures that all users and developers retain the freedom to use, modify, and share the software. It fosters community collaboration, ensuring that any improvements remain accessible to all.
