# Roboflow Datasets

You can now use Roboflow to organize, label, prepare, version, and host your datasets for training YOLOv5 ðŸš€ models. Roboflow is free to use with YOLOv5 if you make your workspace public.

!!! Warning

    Roboflow users can use Ultralytics under the [AGPL license](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/LICENSE) or procure an [Enterprise license](https://ultralytics.com/license) directly from Ultralytics. Be aware that Roboflow does **not** provide Ultralytics licenses, and it is the responsibility of the user to ensure appropriate licensing.

## Upload

You can upload your data to Roboflow via [web UI](https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data), [REST API](https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/upload-api), or [Python](https://docs.roboflow.com/python).

## Labeling

After uploading data to Roboflow, you can label your data and review previous labels.

## Versioning

You can make versions of your dataset with different preprocessing and offline augmentation options. YOLOv5 does online augmentations natively, so be intentional when layering Roboflow's offline augmentations on top.

## Exporting Data

You can download your data in YOLOv5 format to quickly begin training.

```
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR API KEY HERE")
project = rf.workspace().project("YOUR PROJECT")
dataset = project.version("YOUR VERSION").download("yolov5")
```

## Custom Training

We have released a custom training tutorial demonstrating all of the above capabilities. You can access the code here:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/yolov5-custom-training-tutorial/blob/main/yolov5-custom-training.ipynb)

## Active Learning

The real world is messy and your model will invariably encounter situations your dataset didn't anticipate. Using [active learning](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-active-learning/) is an important strategy to iteratively improve your dataset and model. With the Roboflow and YOLOv5 integration, you can quickly make improvements on your model deployments by using a battle tested machine learning pipeline.

This badge indicates that all [YOLOv5 GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/actions) Continuous Integration (CI) tests are successfully passing. These CI tests rigorously check the functionality and performance of YOLOv5 across various key aspects: [training](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/train.py), [validation](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/val.py), [inference](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/detect.py), [export](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/export.py), and [benchmarks](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/benchmarks.py). They ensure consistent and reliable operation on macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu, with tests conducted every 24 hours and upon each new commit.
